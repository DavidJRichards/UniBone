Unibone testplan

Platform: PDP11/34.

Plug UniBone in Slot with NPR/NPG unconnected (CA1 =!= CA2)

1. Slave memory
UniBone implements a memory board.

a) Slave cycles
implement 256Kb 000000-777776 memory.
Boot XXDP2.5, run ZKMA?? with SW= 010000
-> 256KB tested

b) memory layout
Assert memors layout udner ARM = memory layout for PDP-11
load "Papertape Basic" image into DDR RAM
start at 16104 -> BASCI prompt?

c) Address logic
Add 32KB MS11-J board M7847 (00000-077776)
UniBone implements 100000-777776 memory.
Boot XXDP2.5, run ZKMA?? with SW= 010000
-> 256KB tested



2. Bus Master only without arbitration
UniBone performs bus master DMA cycles.
No slave memory emulation, no NPR/G/SACK arbitration.
- add PDP-11 memory board
- Halt CPU (will crash if Unibone generates Bus cycles)

a) single cycle: Set Switchreg to 123456
Unibone: EXAM  777570 ->12345
EXAM next -> Bustimeout

b) perform memory test on PDP-11 memory

3. Bus Master with feed back to internal salve, without arbitration
If master cycles hit addresses for emualted memory, slave logic anwsers master cycles,
This could be an internal operation, but UniBus signals  MSYN/SSYN/Control/DATA/ADDtr are generated

- add 32KB board. Emulates slave memory 100000-777776.

a) UniBone runs memory test
Watch UNIBUS signals: access to real mmeoryy at 00000-077776 should look like itnernal
access to 100000-777776.


4.) Bus master DMA with arbitration
Like 3., but NPR/NPG/SACK arbitration is performed
- plug UniBone in 11/34 between KX11 console and RL11 controller.
Card order: CPU - KY11 - UniBone - RL11
- Confirm that GRANT Chain (CA1/CB1) is open in UniBone backplane slot
- remove jumper between NPG_IN-NPG_OUT
- start Unibone emulation,

a) Boot from RL11. RL11 performs DMA, this works only if UniBone
"connects" NPG_IN to NPG_OUT actively


b) PDP11GUI memory test on lower 56kb 000000-157776
Perform Busmaster memory test per DMA parallel in upper memory- 200000..757776
"tr 200000 777777"
-> lots of NPG transaction in parallel with regualr operation

c) Same as b), but memory test with XXDP ZKMA on lower 56kb 000000-177776 (SR=000000)
- load zkmaf0_200 into memory
- on M9312 console:
@L 200
@G



d) NPR priority: 11/34 KY Programmer console:
HALT -> KY11 is busmaster and holds SACK
UniBone Exam -> seems to hang, as KY11 holds SACK
KY11: CONT -> start CPU, release SACK -> UniBone EXAM gets completed


5) Interrupts
Use "ti" test option and "intrtst" PDP-11 Programm.
Issue interrupts at differnt levels,
combine with different processor pririoty levels.
